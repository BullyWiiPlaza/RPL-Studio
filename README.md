##What is this?
This Java-based utility allows you to unpack an `RPL`/`RPX` Wii U executable to an `ELF` and vice versa.

##What is this useful for?
If you intend to modify an `RPL`/`RPX` for game modding purposes you firstly have to unpack it into an `ELF` whose assembly can be edited in a hex editor. Then you can repack the edited `ELF` again and load the modified `RPL`/`RPX` with e.g. [Loadiine GX2](https://github.com/dimok789/loadiine_gx2).

##Where do I download the application?
[Here](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/RPL-Studio/blob/master/RPL%20Studio.jar?raw=true).

##How does it work?
For unpacking, Hykem's `rpl2elf.exe` is required and included in this repository. For repacking on the other hand, `makerpl64.exe` from the `Nintendo's official SDK` is required.

##Where do I get the SDK?

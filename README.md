## What is this?
This Java-based utility allows you to unpack, edit and repack an `RPL`/`RPX` Wii U executable.

## What is this useful for?
If you intend to modify an `RPL`/`RPX` for game modding purposes you firstly have to unpack it. You can then edit the assembly in a hex editor. Then you should repack it again before trying to load the modified `RPL`/`RPX` with for instance [Loadiine GX2](https://github.com/dimok789/loadiine_gx2).

## Where do I download the application?
[Here](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/RPL-Studio/blob/master/RPL%20Studio.jar?raw=true).

## Do I need to download anything else?
Other than having Java 8 installed, no.

## How does it work?
[`wiiurpxtool`](https://github.com/0CBH0/wiiurpxtool) is used for packing. For unpacking, you have the choice between `wiiurpxtool` and [`rpl2elf`](https://github.com/Relys/rpl2elf).

## How does the application graphical interface look like?
